# Known bug
- Spinner does not show on some devices running Android 11. Should work again on Android 12
- On some games, menu is using old layout such as Kitkat or Gingerbread when launched without permission. We have not found a way to fix it.

# Help, Support, FAQ

See: [Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)](https://github.com/LGLTeam/Android-Mod-Menu/wiki/FAQ) where common questions are answered.

If you have installation or usage problems, try asking your questions on the forum sites. For example, if you have an issue with Hooking and game crashes, you should go to the **support forums**. Here there are no teachers who can help you with such issues. Because of that, issues are disabled permanently due to peoples who have no mind (mostly newbies) aren't even able to fill proper issue templates nor are they able to read the instructions. I get so many useless issues, even useless pull-requests.

**There is no ETA (estimated time of arrival) when I will update, I will never provide ETA no matter what! So you better stop asking such question!**
